Formerly considered a single species, the hoopoe has been split into two separate species: the Eurasian hoopoe and the Madagascar hoopoe. One accepted separate species, the Saint Helena hoopoe, lived on the island of St Helena but became extinct in the 16th century, presumably due to introduced species.[12]

The genus Upupa was created by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758. It then included three other species with long curved bills:[4]

U. eremita (now Geronticus eremita), the northern bald ibis
U. pyrrhocorax (now Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), the red-billed chough
U. paradisea
Formerly, the greater hoopoe-lark (Alaemon alaudipes) was also considered to be a member of this genus (as Upupa alaudipes).[13]

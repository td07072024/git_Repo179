The genus Upupa was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae.[4] The type species is the Eurasian hoopoe (Upupa epops).[5] Upupa and ἔποψ (epops) are respectively the Latin and Ancient Greek names for the hoopoe; both, like the English name, are onomatopoeic forms which imitate the cry of the bird.[6][7]

The hoopoe was classified in the clade Coraciiformes, which also includes kingfishers, bee-eaters, and rollers.[8] A close relationship between the hoopoe and the wood hoopoes is also supported by the shared and unique nature of their stapes.[9] In the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, the hoopoe is separated from the Coraciiformes as a separate order, the Upupiformes. Some authorities place the wood hoopoes in the Upupiformes as well.[10] Now the consensus is that both hoopoe and the wood hoopoes belong with the hornbills in the Bucerotiformes.[11]

The fossil record of the hoopoes is very incomplete, with the earliest fossil coming from the Quaternary.[12] The fossil record of their relatives is older, with fossil wood hoopoes dating back to the Miocene and those of an extinct related family, the Messelirrisoridae, dating from the Eocene.
